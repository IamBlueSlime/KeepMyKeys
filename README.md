### Not published to Curse yet, still work to do on the mod :)

Bored from setting your controls every time you change your modpack? Ah ah ah. This mod is for you.

Thanks to a little button on the `controls` GUI, you can load a old Minecraft `options.txt` file and import your previous controls. Just magic :)
